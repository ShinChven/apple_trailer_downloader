This is a Python script to download HD trailers from the Apple Trailers website
It uses the RSS feed to discover new trailers and keeps track of the ones
it has already downloaded so they aren't re-downloaded.

The script depends on the following imports:
Beautiful Soup 4 (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
Universal Feed Parser (http://code.google.com/p/feedparser/)

Using:

To download trailers in 720p into the script directory, run:
$ python download_trailers.py

You can customize the resolution and download directory if you want.  Copy
settings-example.cfg to settings.cfg and change the values in it.

The script stores a list of files it has already downloaded in the download
directory, in the file download_list.txt.  Any trailer file listed
in the download list will not be re-downloaded, even if the trailer file
has already been deleted.  This allows you to delete trailers after you've
watched them, but still run the script on a regular basis and only download
trailers you've never seen before.
