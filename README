This is a Python script to download HD trailers from the Apple Trailers website
It uses the RSS feed to discover new trailers and keeps track of the ones
it has already downloaded so they aren't re-downloaded.

The script depends on the following imports:
Beautiful Soup (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
Universal Feed Parser (http://code.google.com/p/feedparser/)
