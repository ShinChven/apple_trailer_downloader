This is a Python script to download HD trailers from the Apple Trailers website
It uses the RSS feed to discover new trailers and keeps track of the ones
it has already downloaded so they aren't re-downloaded.

The script depends on the following imports:
Beautiful Soup (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
Universal Feed Parser (http://code.google.com/p/feedparser/)

Using:

To download trailers in 720p into the script directory, run:
$ python download_trailers.py

You can customize the resolution and download directory if you want.  Copy
settings-example.cfg to settings.cfg and change the values in it.

Note that the RSS feed on the Apple Trailers website often lags behind
the web content, so the script may not get the newest trailers that
are available.
